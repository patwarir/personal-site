      <p>
        I&apos;m a Software Developer who graduated from the University of Waterloo
        and I&apos;ve been interested in programming and software development for over {new Date().getUTCFullYear() - 2016} years. Over multiple
        internships, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work with web, cloud and mobile technologies. I also love diving into low-level systems programming, such as figuring out why a compiler
        works or how operating systems are designed. Please feel free to contact me at <span className="font-mono text-sm">rajatpatwari@gmail.com</span>{" "}
        for any questions or opportunities!
